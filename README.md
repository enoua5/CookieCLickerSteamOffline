# CookieCLickerSteamOffline
A Steam Workshop mod for Cookie Clicker that allows production and wrinkler sucking to continue with the game closed.

## Instalation
Since Steam Workshop isn't yet setup for Cookie Clicker, you'll have to install this manually.

From the game's page in your Steam library, click the gear, then `manage > Browse local files`. This will open a file explorer; from there, go to `resources/app/mods/local` and copy the `offlineProduction` directory into `local/` (so, there should be a `local/offlineProduction`).

Once that's done, launch the game. If the mod was enabled automatically, you should see a "Welcome Back!" message pop up in the log. If not, you'll have to go to `Options`, scroll to the bottom, click `manage mods > Offline Production > Enable` and then reload.

## Notes
- I plan on maybe expanding this to allow other things to progress with the game closed.
- Steam achievements are not diabled by using this
- This is very heavily based on [Real Perfect Idling](https://github.com/MSco/RealPerfectIdling) by MSco
